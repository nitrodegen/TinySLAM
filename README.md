<h1>What?</h1>
this Monocular SLAM algorithm is below 300 lines of code.
<br>
No idea how it got to that but ok.

<h1>How?</h1>
<br> This is my first try of SLAM so please just don't judge me ( i will judge myself in 3 months literally.)
Built in Python (SLOW ASF)
<br>
Tested only on one video (i'm scared to try it on other ones).
<br>
Here to say that I actually haven't used any popular "SLAM" techniques, just my basic first-year high-school math and programming skills.
